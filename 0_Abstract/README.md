# WIPER_CONTROL SYSTEM 

## ABSTRACT
#  INTRODUCTION 

Most wipers have a low and a high speed, as well as an intermittent setting. When the wipers are on low and high speed, the motor runs continuously. 
But in the intermittent setting, the wipers stop momentarily between each wipe. There are many different kinds of switches for wipers. 
Some cars have just one intermittent speed, others have 10 discrete settings and still others have a sliding scale that can be set for almost any time interval.

Whichever kind of controls your car has, setting them just right can be tricky -- too fast and the windshield gets dry and the wipers squeak; too slow and your visibility is blocked by raindrops. Compounding this is the fact that the amount of water hitting the windshield changes as your car speeds up and slows down. It can require almost constant attention to keep the wipers operating properly. 
Carmakers may finally have conquered this problem with the holy grail of wiper technology -- the rain-sensing wiper.

Today’s car wipers are manual systems that work on the principle of manual switching.
So here we propose an automatic wiper system that automatically switches ON on detecting rain and stops when rain stops. 
Our project brings forward this system to automate the wiper system having no need for manual intervention. For this purpose we use rain sensor along with microcontroller to drive the wiper motor. 
Our system uses rain sensor to detect rain, this signal is then processed by microcontroller to take the desired action. 

##  BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE 

The rain sensor works on the principle of using water for completing its circuit, so when rain falls on it it’s circuit gets completed and sends out a signal to the microcontroller. 
The microcontroller now processes this data and controls the motor.
This system is equally useful for Aircrafts and a smaller version of this can be used by motor bikers in their helmets so that they can drive easily in rains.
